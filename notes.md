# Data Structures & Algorithms

**Data Structures**  
Organize and store data efficiently. The structure can be linear, non-linear, or other forms depending on requirements.

**Algorithms**  
A step-by-step sequence of operations designed to solve a specific problem or perform a task.

## Types of Data Structures

- **Linear Data Structures:**  
  Data elements are arranged sequentially, one after another.  
  _Examples:_ Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues

- **Non-Linear Data Structures:**  
  Data elements are connected in a hierarchical or networked manner, not sequentially.  
  _Examples:_ Trees, Graphs

\*Linear structures are simple and easy to traverse, while non-linear structures are useful for representing

## Time & Space Complexity

Time Complexity: Indicates how the execution time of an algorithm increases as the input size grows.  
Common notations:

- **Big O (O):** Describes the upper bound (worst-case) performance.
- **Theta (Î˜):** Describes the tight bound (average-case) performance.
- **Omega (Î©):** Describes the lower bound (best-case) performance.

Space Complexity: Indicates how much extra memory an algorithm requires as the input size grows.  
It measures the total space or memory needed, including input, auxiliary

## Bitwise Operators in C++

Bitwise operators work directly on the binary representation of integers.

- **AND (`&`):**  
  Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1.  
  _Example:_ `5 & 3` â†’ `1`

- **OR (`|`):**  
  Sets each bit to 1 if at least one bit is 1.  
  _Example:_ `5 | 3` â†’ `7`

- **XOR (`^`):**  
  Sets each bit to 1 if bits are different.  
  _Example:_ `5 ^ 3` â†’ `6`

  If we use XOR on a list with duplicates it will remove duplicates.

- **NOT (`~`):**  
  Inverts all bits.  
  _Example:_ `~5` â†’ `-6`

---

## Bitwise Shift Operators

- **Left Shift (`<<`):**  
  Shifts bits to the left, adding zeros on the right.  
  Each shift multiplies the number by 2.  
  _Example:_ `3 << 2` â†’ `12` (3 Ã— 4)

- **Right Shift (`>>`):**  
  Shifts bits to the right, discarding rightmost bits.  
  Each shift divides the number by 2 (integer division).  
  _Example:_ `16 >> 3` â†’ `2` (16 Ã· 8)

---

**Tip:**

- use & or ^ operator to check if the number is even or odd.
- use shift operators to traverse bits.
- Use `x & 1` to get the least significant bit (LSB).
- Use bitwise operations for fast multiplication/division by powers of two.

# Linear Data Structures

Linear data structures are those in which elements are arranged sequentially, one after another.  
Each element has a unique predecessor and successor (except the first and last elements).

**Examples:**

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues

**Characteristics:**

- Easy to traverse in a single direction (from start to end).
- Memory is often allocated in a contiguous or linked manner.
- Operations like insertion, deletion, and access depend on the specific type of linear structure.

**Use Cases:**  
Linear data structures are ideal when you need to process data in order, maintain a sequence, or require efficient access to elements.

## 1. Arrays

Arrays store elements of the same type in contiguous memory locations.

- **Static Size:**  
  The size of an array is fixed at the time of creation and cannot be changed.

- **Indexing:**  
  Elements are accessed using an index, starting from `0` up to `n - 1`, where `n` is the size of the array.

---

### Time Complexities for Array Operations

- **Insertion:**

  - At end (if space available): O(1)  
    Direct access to memory allows fast insertion at the end.
  - At specific index: O(n)  
    Inserting at a specific index requires shifting elements to make space.

- **Lookup:**

  - By index: O(1)  
    Direct access to any index.
  - By value (search): depends on algorithm used.
    - O (n) for Linear search.

- **Deletion:**
  - At end: O(1)  
    Removing the last element is fast.
  - At specific index: O(n)  
    Removing an element requires shifting subsequent elements.
  - At start: O(n)  
    All elements must be shifted left by one position.

## Vectors

- A **vector** is a dynamic array that can **grow or shrink** automatically.
- Declared in the `<vector>` header.
- Stores elements **contiguously** in memory (like arrays) but resizes dynamically.

---

### How Vectors Work Internally

- Uses a **dynamically allocated array** internally.
- Keeps track of:
  - **Size** â†’ number of elements currently stored.
  - **Capacity** â†’ allocated memory size before reallocation is needed.
- When capacity is exceeded:
  1. Allocates **new, larger memory** (usually 2Ã— old capacity).
  2. Copies old elements into new space.
  3. Frees old memory.

---

### Declaring & Initializing a Vector

```cpp
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

vector<int> v1;                 // empty vector
vector<int> v2 = {1, 2, 4, 6, 6}; // initializer list
vector<int> v3(5, 10);          // size=5, all values=10
vector<int> v4(v2);             // copy constructor
vector<int> v5(v2.begin(), v2.end()); // from iterators
```

### Adding Elements

```cpp
v.push_back(5);  // append at end
v.emplace_back(5); // append (in-place, faster for objects)
v.insert(v.begin() + 2, 99); // insert at position (iterator)

    Note: insert can also insert ranges:
    v.insert(pos, count, value);
    v.insert(pos, other.begin(), other.end());
```

### Size & Capacity

```cpp
v.size();      // number of elements
v.capacity();  // allocated storage
v.max_size();  // max possible elements
v.reserve(100); // pre-allocate space
v.shrink_to_fit(); // free unused capacity
```

### Accessing Elements

```cpp
v.at(2);     // safe access (throws exception if out-of-range)
v[2];        // direct access (no bounds check)
v.front();   // first element
v.back();    // last element
v.data();    // pointer to internal array
```

### Removing Elements

```cpp
v.pop_back();              // remove last
v.erase(v.begin() + 3);    // remove at position
v.erase(v.begin() + 2, v.begin() + 5); // remove range
v.clear();                 // remove all
```

Checking Status

```cpp
v.empty(); // true if vector is empty
```

### Common Algorithms with Vectors

```cpp
#include <algorithm>

// Reverse
reverse(v.begin(), v.end());

// Sort ascending
sort(v.begin(), v.end());

// Sort descending
sort(v.begin(), v.end(), greater<int>());

// Remove duplicates
sort(v.begin(), v.end());
v.erase(unique(v.begin(), v.end()), v.end());
```

ðŸ’¡ Notes & Best Practices

    Pass by reference (const vector<int>& v) to avoid expensive copies.

    Use reserve() when size is known to avoid multiple reallocations.

    Prefer emplace_back() for constructing objects directly in place.

    Remember: Insertions/removals at the end are O(1) amortized,
    but in the middle or front are O(n).

## 2. Linked Lists

A **linked list** is a linear data structure where elements (nodes) are connected together in sequence.

 Linked lists nodes are not stored at a contiguous location, rather they are linked using pointers to the different memory locations.


Each node contains:

- **Data:** The value stored in the node.
- **Pointer (next):** Reference to the next node in the list.

```cpp
struct Node {
    int value;
    Node* next;
};
```

---

### Types of Linked Lists

- **Singly Linked List:**  
  Each node points to the next node. Traversal is possible in one direction only.

- **Doubly Linked List:**  
  Each node has pointers to both the next and previous nodes. Traversal is possible in both directions.

- **Circular Linked List:**  
  The last node points back to the first node, forming a circle.

---

### Key Operations

- **Insertion:**

  - At beginning: O(1)
  - At end: O(n) (unless tail pointer is maintained)
  - At specific position: O(n)

- **Deletion:**

  - At beginning: O(1)
  - At end or specific position: O(n)

- **Traversal:**
  - Visit each node from head to end: O(n)

---

### Memory Allocation in Linked Lists

- **Dynamic Allocation:**  
  Linked lists use dynamic memory allocation for each node.  
  When a new node is inserted, memory is allocated on the heap using `new` (in C++).

- **Node Structure:**  
  Each node contains:

  - Data (the value)
  - Pointer(s) to the next (and/or previous) node(s)

- **Insertion:**

  - When inserting a node, a new block of memory is allocated for the node.
  - The pointer in the previous node is updated to reference the new node.
  - No need to shift other elements (unlike arrays).

- **Deletion:**

  - When deleting a node, the pointer in the previous node is updated to skip the deleted node.
  - The memory occupied by the deleted node is freed (`delete` in C++).

- **Traversal:**
  - Traversal does not allocate or free memory; it simply follows pointers from node to node.

---

### Advantages

- **Dynamic size:** Can grow or shrink during runtime.
- **Efficient insertion/deletion** at the beginning.

### Disadvantages

- **No random access:** Must traverse from head to access a specific element.
- **Extra memory:** Each node stores a pointer.
