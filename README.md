### Folder Details

- **notes.md**  
  Detailed notes and explanations on data structures, algorithms, time/space complexity, and C++ bitwise operations.

- **basics/**  
  Contains introductory implementations of core data structures (ArrayList, LinkedList, Stack) and basic algorithms.

- **linear/**  
  Implements STL-based linear data structures (`list`, `vector`, `map`, `stack`) with usage examples and notes.

- **leetcode/**  
  Contains solutions to LeetCode problems, organized by topic:

  - **Arrays/**: Array manipulation, searching, sorting, and algorithmic problems.
  - **LinkedLists/**: Linked list operations, cycle detection, node swapping, etc.
  - **Stacks/**: Stack-based problems, including custom stack implementations and algorithms.

## How to Use

- Explore each folder for code samples and problem solutions.
- Refer to `notes.md` for conceptual understanding.
- Build and run `.cpp` files using your preferred C++ compiler or the provided VS Code tasks.

### Note:

Although this is a personal repository, I value clear explanations for each solution. Please include your reasoning for the chosen approach, a dry-run with sample test cases, and the intuition behind.

Happy coding and learning! ❤️
